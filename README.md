## Environment setting
**Attention :** To utilize GPU acceleration for this project, it is recommended to install CUDA 11.6 before running the program. Alternatively, you can run the program using your CPU, but please be aware that it may result in significantly slower performance.

After that, you can install others package through the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note** : If you encounter the error message about CUDA out of memory, you can optimize the situation by trying the following approaches:

1. Use a smaller batch size: Decrease the number of samples processed in each iteration to reduce memory consumption.
2. Load a smaller model: If possible, choose a smaller or more memory-efficient model architecture.

These optimizations can help mitigate the CUDA out of memory error and allow smoother execution of your program.
